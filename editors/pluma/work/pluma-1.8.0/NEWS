pluma 1.8.0
===========

  * Add GTK3 support
  * Use yelp-tools instead of mate-doc-utils
  * Move user plugin dir from config_dir to data_dir. Plugins should have
    never been installed in the config dir as they are not part of the
    configuration. This means user will need to move the plugins directory
    from: $HOME/.config/pluma/ to $HOME/.local/share/pluma/.

pluma 1.5.0
===========

  * Migration to GSettings and drop mateconf
    (All code is migrated, except pythonconsole plugin. The plugin works,
    except you cant configure it; the configurable things were command
    and error colors; this will be fixed migrating the plugin to Gir
    instead of python-gtk)
