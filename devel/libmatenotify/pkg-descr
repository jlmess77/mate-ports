The Desktop Notifications framework provides a standard way of doing passive
pop-up notifications on the desktop. These are designed to notify the
user of something without interrupting their work with a dialog box that they
must close. Passive popups can automatically disappear after a short period
of time.

This port contains the library and a small command line client.
See deskutils/mate-notification-daemon for the daemon.
