To paraphrase the README:

This is a Python language binding for the MateCORBA2 CORBA implementation.
It aims to take advantage of new features found in MateCORBA2 to make
language bindings more efficient.  This includes:
  - Use of MateCORBA2 type libraries to generate stubs
  - use of the ORBit_small_invoke_stub() call for operation
    invocation, which allows for short circuited invocation on local
    objects.
