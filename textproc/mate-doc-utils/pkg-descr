The MATE Doc Utils is a collection of documentation utilities for the MATE
project. Notably, it contains utilities for building documentation and all
auxiliary files in the source tree, and it contains the DocBook XSLT
stylesheets that were once distributed with Yelp. Yelp requires MATE Doc
Utils for the XSLT.
