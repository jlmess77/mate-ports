#. breaks the states up into groups of states that
#. generally make the same decision in a given year. Thus,
#. in any given year, several of the time zones will appear
#. to be redundant, but exactly which ones seem redundant
#. may differ from year to year, and there's no good way to
#. identify the zones other than by listing states.
#. Anyway, "Brasília Time" is the most common timezone,
#. being used by about a third of the states in Brazil
#. (Distrito Federal, Espírito Santo, Goiás, Minas Gerais,
#. Paraná, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa
#. Catarina, and São Paulo). This string is only used in
